# Web interface for mass payment of salaries in MT101 format

These are 2 simple and ugly web forms:

1. list of employees with their IBANs and usual salary (fired persons are not deleted, but will not show in the next monthly payments)
2. monthly salaries (per month) with export in MT-101 format

You need to configure the name of your company and each of your IBANs (in different banks) in file DBASE.PHP
